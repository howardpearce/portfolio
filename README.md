My Web Portfolio
================

This project is a website that allows me to showcase work that I have done via 
my hobbies. It is intended to demonstrate my skill as a software developer, by 
projects I have posted on it, and also the fact that I have built this project 
on my own from scratch.

History
=======

I have been working on a personal portfolio for years now, and this this revision number 6.
Each attempt has given me invaluable experience in project management, networking and design. 
I still hope this is the last version though.

Intent
======

The portfolio is a public display of my work (software or not) that I am proud of.
Its existence also should also be an achievement in of itself.

Learning
========

Undertaking this project has taught me quite a bit. Some
of the topics that I have learned include the following subjects:

**Networking:** I have learned much about how DNS servers work and how to 
redirect a request to a domain name to my personal computer. Subjects like
Resource Records, SSL Certificates, HTTP and HTTPS protocols are some of the
topics that I understand in detail through this project.

**Angular:** After taking an online course in Angular, I am applying what I've
learned via the development of this website.

**Design:** Graphic Design and web design have always been a great source of 
frustration for me. I have no formal education in either, but I want to create a 
product with a professional look and feel. The Design principles I have learned
have been valuable, and through external design consultations and education 
using online resources, I hope to learn a great deal more.

**CI/CD:** While still simple, I have implemented my own CI suite for this
gitlab project through the use of Jenkins CI. I hope to learn more about CI and
CD as this project grows in scale and complexity.

**Project Management:** Using the project management tools offered by Gitlab has
been insightful. My experience with the Agile Methodology at work has also given
me some insight into this project. I am not practicing Agile in this project
since I am the only contributor, but I am managing my work using issues, and
the use of tags + milestones has given me valuable insight into how I can divide
project work into easily workable sections.

Future plans
============

**Dedicated Hardware:** I am currently hosting this on my gaming PC, but would
like to tranisition to using raspberry pi hardware to host. This offers more 
security since I can host the website inside of a DMZ. This also allows me to 
set up my own deployment suite to gain valuable experience.

**Graphic Design Practice:** This project allows me to experiment with graphic
design as well as user experience design. I intend to have an external designer
or design agency provide me with a style guide that I can implement to learn
more about website design, as well as have a sharp looking website to represent
me.
