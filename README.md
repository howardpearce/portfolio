My Web Portfolio
================

This project is a website that allows me to showcase work that I have done via 
my hobbies. It is intended to demonstrate my skill as a software developer.

I have been working on a personal portfolio for years now, this is revision number 6.
Each attempt has given me lots of experience in project management, networking and UI design.
