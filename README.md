My Web Portfolio
================

This project is a website that allows me to showcase work that I have done via 
my hobbies. It is intended to demonstrate my skill as a software developer.

I have been working on a personal portfolio for years now, this is revision number 6.
Each attempt has given me lots of experience in project management, networking and UI design. 

What I've learned
========

Undertaking this project has taught me quite a bit. Some
of the topics that I have learned include the following subjects:

**Networking:** I have learned a lot about how DNS servers work and how to 
redirect a request to a domain name to my personal computer. Subjects like
Resource Records, SSL Certificates, HTTP and HTTPS protocols are some of the
topics that I understand in detail through this project.

**Angular:** After taking an online course in Angular, I am applying what I've
learned to develop this website.

**Design:** Graphic Design and web design have always been a source of 
frustration for me. I have no formal education in either, but I want to create a 
product with a professional look and feel. The Design principles I have learned
have been valuable, and through external design consultations and education 
using online resources, I hope to learn a great deal more.

**CI/CD:** While still simple, I plan to implement my own CI suite for this
gitlab project through the use of Jenkins CI. I hope to learn more about CI and
CD as this project grows in scale and complexity.

**Project Management:** Using the project management tools offered by Gitlab has
been insightful. My experience with the Agile Methodology at work has also given
me some insight into this project.
